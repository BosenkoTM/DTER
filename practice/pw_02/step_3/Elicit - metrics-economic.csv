- The profitability ratios include EBITDA, ROA, ROE, and ROS, which are used to measure financial performance.
- Labour productivity is measured by the ratio of value added to personnel expenses, indicating operational performance.
- The operating ratio is calculated as operating expenses minus depreciation divided by revenues from sold goods plus production, also an operational performance measure.
- The paper categorizes these metrics into financial and operational performance indicators, with specific calculations and interpretations for each.
