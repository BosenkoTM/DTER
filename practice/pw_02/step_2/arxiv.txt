Agentic generative AI for media content discovery at the national football league

Authors: Henry Wang, Sirajus Salekin, Jake Lee, Ross Claytor, Shinan Zhang, Michael Chi

Abstract: Generative AI has unlocked new possibilities in content discovery and management. Through collaboration with the National Football League (NFL), we demonstrate how a generative-AI based workflow enables media researchers and analysts to query relevant historical plays using natural language rather than traditional filter-and-click interfaces. The agentic wor… ▽ More

Spec2Control: Automating PLC/DCS Control-Logic Engineering from Natural Language Requirements with LLMs - A Multi-Plant Evaluation

Authors: Heiko Koziolek, Thilo Braun, Virendra Ashiwal, Sofia Linsbauer, Marthe Ahlgreen Hansen, Karoline Grotterud

Abstract: Distributed control systems (DCS) manage the automation for many industrial production processes (e.g., power plants, chemical refineries, steel mills). Programming the software for such systems remains a largely manual and tedious process, incurring costs of millions of dollars for extensive facilities. Large language models (LLMs) have been found helpful i… ▽ More

SSM-CGM: Interpretable State-Space Forecasting Model of Continuous Glucose Monitoring for Personalized Diabetes Management

Authors: Shakson Isaac, Yentl Collin, Chirag Patel

Abstract: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) generates dense data streams critical for diabetes management, but most used forecasting models lack interpretability for clinical use. We present SSM-CGM, a Mamba-based neural state-space forecasting model that integrates CGM and wearable activity signals from the AI-READI cohort. SSM-CGM improves short-term accuracy over… ▽ More
